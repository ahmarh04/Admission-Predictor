# 🎓 Admission Predictor

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to predict the likelihood of admission to graduate programs based on applicants' profiles. The notebook uses machine learning techniques to analyze historical admissions data and provide insights and predictions for prospective students.

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Admission Predictor** leverages data science to estimate a student’s chance of admission based on factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, GPA, and more. This project provides:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature importance.
- Data preprocessing to handle missing or skewed data.
- Model training and evaluation to predict admission probabilities.
- An interactive interface for users to input their own data and test the model.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore correlations between academic and non-academic factors and admission outcomes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data, handling outliers, missing values, and normalization.
- **Model Training**: Builds and trains machine learning models to estimate admission probabilities.
- **Evaluation**: Analyzes model performance through accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- **Interactive Prediction**: Allows users to input their own academic profile and receive an admission probability prediction.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

Install these via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

Installation
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmarh04/admission-predictor.git
```
Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd admission-predictor
```
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "ADMISSION PREDICTOR.ipynb"
```
Usage
Launch the notebook in Jupyter and run each cell sequentially.
Perform data exploration, model training, and evaluation as directed in the notebook.
Use the prediction interface at the end of the notebook to input your details and receive an admission probability estimate.
